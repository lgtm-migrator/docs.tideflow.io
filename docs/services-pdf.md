The PDF integration allows you to generate and customise PDF files based on HTML
templates that you may create in your Files section.

PDF files, as with any other file generated by actions, can be connected to other
flow tasks.

<hr>

For example, when a user submits a webform with its username on it, you can use
the following template to generate a PDF and get it sent to the user's email
inbox.

<figure>
  <img src="/img/pdf_greeting_flow.jpg" 
    style="border:1px solid gray;" />
  <figcaption>Fig.1 - Example workflow using PDF files.</figcaption>
</figure>

<br>

The following template will generate [this PDF file](/services/pdf/pqi-pqiwasp6ywdzqf8me.pdf).

```html
<h1>Hello {{username}}!</h1>
<p>We are very happy to have you onboard!</p>
<br><br>
<p>...</p>
```
