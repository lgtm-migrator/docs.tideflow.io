Tideflow integrates with [webParsy](https://github.com/joseconstela/webparsy). An easy to use web scraper written in NodeJS that uses YAML definitions.

With WebParsy's service, you can obtain data from websites and use it as part of
your processes logic.

When adding your web scraper step to your workflows, you must define the web
scraping tasks via the UI.

A quick example that scrapes Madridâ€™s temperature would be:

```yaml
jobs:
  main:
    steps:
      - goto: https://weather.com/es-ES/tiempo/hoy/l/SPXX0050:1:SP
      - text:
          selector: .today_nowcard-temp span
          type: number
          as: madrid_temperature
```

Tideflow will send the result of the web scraping process to your process' next
step.

Please visit WebParsy documentation to know more about its possibilities and its examples.
