The outgoing email services allows you to send emails to either your email address,
(the one you use to login into Tideflow), or to others' email addresses.

You can customise the email's subject, message and attach the output from the previous
workflow's step.

If the previous workflow's step resulted in a file or files, they will be attached to the
email.

As other examples on attaching the previous step's output:

- [RSS articles](/docs/services-rss) or [Github issues](/docs/installation-instructions) are shown as lists on the email's body.
- [PDF files](/docs/services-pdf) are attached as files.
- [Endpoint's](/docs/services-email-outgoing) POST request's body is shown in pretty format.
