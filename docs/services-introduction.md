Services are the gem of Tideflow.

They provide Tideflow with compatibility and integration with third-party
services, allow workflows to create files, send emails, etc., all from the
actions that users define as part of their processes.

Services can be classified as two types.

1. Services that trigger processes: for example, a date, someone visiting an
URL, etc.
2. Services that produces an output: for example, sending an email, creating a 
PDF file, running a command, etc.

In this section of the documentation, you will get to know and understand all 
the services that are included by default in Tideflow.

If you are interesting in learning how to create new services, visit the
[Creating Services](/docs/developers-creating-services) section.
