Executions are the way to track the progress of workflows.

When a workflow's trigger is fired, Tideflow's creates a history of its progress.

This allows you to know if a workflow finished executing, how many times, how
long did it take to complete, track successes and failures, etc.

But not only that. Tideflow tracks each step of an execution independently.
