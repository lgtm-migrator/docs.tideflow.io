When a workflows is executed, Tideflow tracks its progress from start to finish.

This monitorization process is transparent for the users, and Tideflow presents
them the workflow's journey (we call it "the workflow's execution) in realtime.

Users can also opt-in to receive a daily or weekly sumary by email of all their
workflows activity.
