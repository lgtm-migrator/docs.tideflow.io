Tideflow allows you to track the progress of workflows in realtime. When a
workflow's trigger is fired, Tideflow creates a history of its progress.

This allows you to know how many times a workflow got executed, if it finished
executing, how long did it take to complete, track successes and failures and
each step progress with its logs.
