In order to help developers to boost their imagination and peace, we have
developed a mobile application (using Ionic) that already integrates with Tideflow.

Specificly it integrates with any workflow that is triggered via a endpoint.

Some of its features:

- Integrates with User API Key. One QR is enought to authenticate yourself.
- Send basic JSON objects.
- Scan barcodes and QR codes and trigger your workflows.
- Take photos and trigger your workflows with them.
- Documment scanning (photo tilt correction) to trigger workflows.
