The Webform service allows you to create custom web forms you can share with others.

When you create a webform, Tideflow will assign it an URL that will look something
similar to: `https://tideflow.example.com/webform/87479c63-296e-4087-a2d5-8028e2fa9e1c`.

When you share this url, others will see you form. 

You can trigger workflows when users fill and submit this forms.
