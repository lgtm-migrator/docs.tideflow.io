The Webform service allows you to create custom web forms that you can share
with others.

When you create a webform, Tideflow will assign it an URL that will look something
similar to: `https://tideflow.example.com/webform/87479c63-296e-4087-a2d5-8028e2fa9e1c`.

When you share this url, others will see the form you have created.

The forms can be used as workflow triggers, so when someone fills it, you run
a process with the data the user submited.

The forms services also allows you to customise a message shows to the user
after he/she submited the form, and redirect the user to a custom URL.
