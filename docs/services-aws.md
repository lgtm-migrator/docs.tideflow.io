AWS integration let's your workflows interact with your AWS resources.

The AWS Integration allows you to setup different IAM credentials with
multi region support, and choose which profile use when your workflows
are interacting with AWS resources.

The current service works for both retrieving and updating a device
shadow. This enables users to control IoT devices and understand their
status.

To start, go to "Services", select "Amazon Web Services" and specify
your IAM security credentials. You can have multiple profiles and choose
which one use later on.
