Workflows are sets of actions that happen upon a trigger.

There are multitude of triggers. From an employee or a website visitor submiting
an online form, a webservice url reached by some system, an specific date or a
time interval...

Tideflow allows you to create as many workflows as you want. As easy as drag and
drop.
