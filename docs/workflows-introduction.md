A workflow is a process you want to automate.

In Tideflow, this are a set of actions to accomplish your goal or produce a
desired output.

Workflows happen are are executed when certain thing happens. We call this: the
trigger, and can be either an specific time in which something must happen, or
an input something or someone has triggered.

Tideflow allows you to create as many workflows as you want. As easy as drag and
drop.
