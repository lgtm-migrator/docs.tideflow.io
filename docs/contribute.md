First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Please note there is a [code of conduct](/docs/code-of-conduct), please follow
it in all your interactions with the project and its community.

## How can I contribute to Tideflow?

Add an star on Github for [the main repository](https://github.com/tideflow-io/tideflow),
it really helps a lot!

You can also use Tideflow for your own purposes and report any issue or bug
you may found.

There are some tasks on the backlogs. Check https://github.com/tideflow-io/tideflow/issues

Any ideas, comments and pull requests helps hugely to the project.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before doing a build.
2. Update the issue or the pull request descriptions with details of changes
   commited, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, etc.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the
   new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we
   use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of other
   developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request a
   second reviewer to merge it for you.
