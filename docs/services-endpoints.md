Endpoints allows you to connect other applications to Tideflow and trigger workflows 
via an URL.

When you create an endpoint, Tideflow will assign an URL to it. It will look something
similar to: `https://tideflow.example.com/endpoint/87479c63-296e-4087-a2d5-8028e2fa9e1c`.

This URL can then be visited via a browser or reached via another application to submit
data to your workflows.
