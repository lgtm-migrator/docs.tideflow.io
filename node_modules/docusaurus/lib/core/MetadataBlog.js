This is a single step process that will create your first user credentials as well as some other necessary settings. [See the installation instructions](https://docs.tideflow.io/docs/installation-instructions)\n\nOther new features are:\n\n*   PDF creation is now done via [Pupetter](https://github.com/GoogleChrome/puppeteer), instead of [pdfkit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pdfkit). This makes imagination the only limit for creating PDF files. At the moment there are only 2 templates. Many more will be available soon. Stay tunned or [contribute](https://docs.tideflow.io/docs/contribute) with your own [templates](https://github.com/tideflow-io/tideflow/tree/master/private/pdfs)!\n*   [Webforms](https://docs.tideflow.io/docs/services-webforms) are now available. This service allows you to create custom forms that you can share with others.\n*   …\n\nIf you want to contribute with Tideflow, take a look to [https://docs.tideflow.io/docs/contribute](https://docs.tideflow.io/docs/contribute) You can start as simple as adding a star on GitHub for [the main repository](https://github.com/tideflow-io/tideflow), it really helps a lot!\n",
